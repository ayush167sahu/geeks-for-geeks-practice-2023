        //**********************************
        //for the follong code we will use the dutch national flag algorithm
        //as we are using only one algorithn the time complexity of the following algorithm 
        //will be log(n)
        
        //intuition
        //we will take 3 pointer low,mid,high
        //0-low-1 will contain only zeroes
        //low to mid-1 will only contain 1's
        //**imp mid to high will only contain the unsorted elements
        //here as the whole array is unorsorted means that mid is 0 and high is n-1;
        //and as low is the starting index it is 0;
        //*****
        //we will check the mid 
        //1->if we encounter 0 zero we will swap it with the low which is in lest half
        //2->if we encounter 1 we will then  increase the mid ans decrease the unsoreted array
        //3->if we encounter 2 we will thn place it towards the last i.e right half and decrease the unsoreted array
